                I am third-year BTech student in Computer Science and Engineering, graduating in 2026.
                I have over a year of experience in full-stack development using the MERN stack.
                Currently, I am exploring Web3, Golang and focusing on improving my problem-solving skills.
                I have worked on various projects and internships,
                showcasing my ability to deliver efficient and scalable solutions.
